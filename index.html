    <h2 style="color:red; text-align:center;">Brief Greeting</h2>
    <p style="color:white; text-align:center;">Hello, GitHub! I am learning to make a website! Please enjoy watching this grow into a functional website.</p>
    <h2 style="color:red; text-align:center;">About Me</h2>
    <p style="color:white; text-align:center;">I am Austin Dart. I am a Java developer who has spent much of my time making Bukkit/Spigot plugins. I am now beginning my journey as a web developer, 
        hoping to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website is going to be the project by which I (and you) can see my progress. Here's a picture of my face:<br>
        <img src="images/selfie.jpg" width="132" height="256"><br>
		Please note that while the code for this website is licensed under the Unlicense (that is, it is essentially within the public domain), the photo is NOT. I own 
		this photograph and it is not to be used by anyone else (not really sure why you would want to, either).
    </p>
