# Making-A-Website
Join me on my adventure as I learn to make a website (Probably with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)

## May 4, 2022
- Added index.html with a very basic paragraph

## May 5, 2022
- Set up a workflow to automatically publish to GitHub Pages (https://austindart.github.io/Making-A-Website)
- Added a heading (\<h1\>) to index.html
- Added a subheading (\<h2\>) to index.html
- Added a link to (\<a href\>) to index.html
- Added line break (\<br\>) and selfie (\<img\>)

## May 6, 2022
- Made the background black and the text white (using style inside of html tags)

## May 7, 2022
- Made the sub-headers red instead of white.
