# Making-A-Website
Join me on my adventure as I learn to make a website (Probably with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)

## May 4, 2022
- I added index.html with a very basic paragraph

## May 5, 2022
- I set up a workflow to automatically publish to GitHub Pages (https://austindart.github.io/Making-A-Website)
- I added a heading (\<h1\>) to index.html
- I added a subheading (\<h2\>) to index.html
