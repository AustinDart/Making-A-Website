# Making-A-Website
Join me on my adventure as I learn to make a website (Probably with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)

## May 4, 2022
- Added index.html with a very basic paragraph

## May 5, 2022
- Set up a workflow to automatically publish to GitHub Pages (https://austindart.github.io/Making-A-Website)
- Added a heading (\<h1\>) to index.html
- Added a subheading (\<h2\>) to index.html
- Added a link to (\<a href\>) to index.html
- Added line break (\<br\>) and selfie (\<img\>)

## May 6, 2022
- Used style inside html tags to change colors of background and text (color & background-color)

## May 7, 2022
- Made the sub-headers red instead of white.
- Used style inside html tags to move everything to the center of the page (text-align)
- Use \<b\>, \<i\>, \<sup\>, \<sub\>, \<del\>, and \<ins\>
- Use \<style\> instead of defining style within individual tags (internal instead of inline).
- I've opted not to use external styling for now (I might later, though)
- Updated the link to open in a new tab (_blank)
- Add a favicon (my art skills are garbage so ignore that)
