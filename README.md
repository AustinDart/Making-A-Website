# Making-A-Website
Join me on my adventure as I learn to make a website (Probably with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)

## Day 1:
- I added index.html with a very basic paragraph

## Day 2:
- I set up a workflow to automatically publish to GitHub Pages (https://austindart.github.io/Making-A-Website)
- I added a heading (\<h1\>) to index.html
