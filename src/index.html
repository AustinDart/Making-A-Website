    <h1>Making A Website</h1>
    <h2>Brief Greeting</h2>
    <p>Hello, GitHub! I am learning to make a website! Please enjoy watching this grow into a functional website.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Austin Dart. I am a Java developer who has spent much of my time making Bukkit/Spigot plugins. I am now beginning my journey as a web developer, 
        hoping to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website is going to be the project by which I (and you) can see my progress. Here's a picture of my face:<br>
        <img src="images/selfie.jpg" style="width:132px;height:256px;" alt="A picture of my face"><br>
		Please note that while the code for this website is licensed under the Unlicense (that is, it is essentially within the public domain), the photo is NOT. I own 
		this photograph and it is not to be used by anyone else (not really sure why you would want to, either).
    </p>
    <h2>Source Code</h2>
    <p>The source code for this website is (and always will be) publicly available. Right now, it is available at 
        <a href="https://github.com/AustinDart/Making-A-Website" target="_blank">https://github.com/AustinDart/Making-A-Website</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Math & Science Things</h2>
    <p>In order to demonstrate various HTML tags, I'm going to be utilizing <b><i>MATH & SCIENCE</i></b><br>
